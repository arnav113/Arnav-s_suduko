# Arnav-s_suduko
A Bootcamp project(II week) , organized by Graphic Era Deemed To Be University.
@ The attached code in this repository is the project in c++ language. It is the code comprises of the way to solve the suduko using BACKTRACKING APPROACH.

@Tools and Technology used:
       * c++ programing language
       * visual studio code 2019
       * GCC compiler
       
@ Modules of the project:
# Many user-defined functions have been used to make the project successfull, are as follows-:
 * HEADER FILES : <iostream> and <stdlib.h> are the header files used herein.
 * NAMESPACES AND MACROS : "using namespace std" is the namespace and "#define n 9"(it provides the value n as 9) macro is being used in the program. 
 * MAIN FUNCTIONS : main() function is used to take the suduko as input in the form of matrix and used to call other user defined functions.
 * USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS : 
            $ operate()   : is used to apply backtracking in the program.
            $$ valid()    : is used to check if the number is to be enterd is valid for the sudoku or not.
            $$$ display() : is used to display/print the output or solved sudoku. 
  
@ APPLICATION -:
# The Program can be used to get the solution of any valid sudoku.
